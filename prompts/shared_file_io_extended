        I have attached a csv file which you can load into a dataframe using pandas. The csv contains I/O trace information from an application run on an HPC system and the data was collected using darshan. The data contains the following columns:

        {'file_id': 'unique ID assigned to each file', 'file_name': 'Path and name of the file', 'api': 'I/O library being used', 'rank': 'MPI rank from which the operation was called', 'operation': "type of I/O call ('read', 'write', 'open', 'stat')", 'segment': 'portion of a file that is accessed during an I/O operation', 'offset': 'position within a file where a particular I/O operation begins', 'size': 'amount of data read from or written to a file during an I/O operation in bytes', 'start': 'unix timestamp of the start of the I/O operation', 'end': 'unix timestamp of the end of the I/O operation', 'ost': 'lustre OST used by the I/O operation', 'consec': 'boolean to indicate if current offset is greater than the previous offset+size', 'seq': 'boolean to indicate if current offset is equal to the previous offset + size'}

        HPC I/O works in the following way. All the ranks (processes) running on different computing nodes will issue multiple I/O requests to different OST servers, which are the storage servers. The OST servers split data files into chunks which are known as stripes, where each stripe has a size of stripe_size the stripes of a file are stored across stripe_count different OST servers. If the I/O requests target different files, then they are called independent file accesses. If they target different regions of the same file, then they are called shared file accesses. Generally, independent file accesses are more efficient because each process conducts I/O independently towards its own file. But, if there are too many processes reading and writing to too many independent files, the metadata load may become an issue as the load on the metadata servers may be very high. Since shared file accesses only access one file, the metadata servers will not have a very high load, but many processes accessing the same file may complicate data access for the OSTs. This is because these processes may access overlapping areas of the file, introducing conflicts and lock overheads. Even if these requests are not overlapped, they may be accessing the same data stripe of the file (i.e. two request offsets are within the range of the stripe size of the file). This will also lead to lower performance as they introduce conflicts. The I/Os will be sent to the same OST server as well, reducing the parallelism. The files accessed in the application trace have a stripe_size of 1MB and a stripe_count of 1.
                        To identify if an application has shared file issue, we need to take following items into consideration
                            1. Many or all processes access the same file. 
                            2. Accessing the same file happens repeatedly.
                            3. Requests from different processes are overlapped in terms of time.
                            4. Requests from different processes fall into the same file stripe, i.e., the offsets of these requests are within the stripe size of the file. The stripe size is 1MB.
                        Please use the provided information and think step by step to diagnose whether the attached trace file contains any shared file I/O behavior which may be cause for concern. Following your analysis, write a brief summary of your diagnosis in the following format:

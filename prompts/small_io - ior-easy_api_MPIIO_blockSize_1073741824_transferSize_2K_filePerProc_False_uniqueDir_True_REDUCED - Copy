        I have attached a csv file which you can load into a dataframe using pandas. The csv contains I/O trace information from an application run on an HPC system and the data was collected using darshan. The data contains the following columns:

        {'file_id': 'unique ID assigned to each file', 'file_name': 'Path and name of the file', 'api': 'I/O library being used', 'rank': 'MPI rank from which the operation was called', 'operation': "type of I/O call ('read', 'write', 'open', 'stat')", 'segment': 'portion of a file that is accessed during an I/O operation', 'offset': 'position within a file where a particular I/O operation begins', 'size': 'amount of data read from or written to a file during an I/O operation in bytes', 'start': 'unix timestamp of the start of the I/O operation', 'end': 'unix timestamp of the end of the I/O operation', 'ost': 'lustre OST used by the I/O operation', 'consec': 'boolean to indicate if current offset is greater than the previous offset+size', 'seq': 'boolean to indicate if current offset is equal to the previous offset + size'}

        HPC I/O works in the following way: All the ranks (processes) running on different computing nodes will issue multiple I/O requests to different OST servers, which are the storage servers. The I/O requests will be transferred using RPC (remote procedure call). If an I/O request is smaller than the RPC size it may be aggregated with others if they are sequential, but otherwise it may lead to inefficient use of the RPC channel since a RPC transfer includes connection building and destroying overheads. The small I/O can mostly be ignored if the application only accesses a file once or twice via small I/O requests, because it is common for an application to load small configuration file, which tends to create small I/O requests. However, repetitive I/O requests to the same file which are significantly smaller than the RPC size may be an issue. Note that, the system on which the trace was collected is configured with a page size of 4kb and max_pages_per_rpc set to 1024, which indicates that the maximum RPC size is 4MB.
                    To diagnose the issue, first analyze the size of the I/O requests, then check to see if any of the requests identified as small are accessing the same files multiple times, and finally check if any of the small requests might be aggregated based on their access patterns. Following your analysis, write a brief summary of your diagnosis in the following format:
                    Diagnosis: <summary of your diagnosis>
